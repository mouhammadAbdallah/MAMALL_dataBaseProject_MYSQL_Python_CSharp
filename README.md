Database project for a big mall containing many shops and every shop has many employees.  
The application can be used from different interfaces: one for the admins and other for the employees in every shop. 

The database was MYSQL and Python is the main used language along with C# for some designs.

details:  

It is a GUI for a big mall that contains many shops.  
In each shop there are many employees.  
In the mall, the admins can create shops, add employees and see reports about the entire mall.  
In the shop, the employee can add suppliers, new products and offers and he can create invoices.

For that, I used the MYSQL database Server to create a database and I developed an interactive UI using C# for the design and Python to connect to the database, analyze the data and plot figures.
